# Facebook Instant Games SDK for Unity

This package provides C# bindings to the Facebook Instant Games SDK, making it easy to integrate Facebook Instant Games with your Unity project. Since the Facebook Instant Games SDK is originally a JavaScript SDK, this package is compatible only with web builds.

Key features include identity verification, user data access, in-app purchases, and social sharing integrations. By using this package, Unity developers can leverage the same powerful tools for analytics, monetization, and player engagement that Meta developers use, bringing top-tier social gaming experiences to their web-based Unity games.

This package is available as an pre-release package, so it's not ready for production use. The features and documentation in this package might change before it's verified for release.
