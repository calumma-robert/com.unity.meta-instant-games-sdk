# Facebook Instant Games SDK for Unity

This package provides C# bindings to the Facebook Instant Games SDK, making it easy to integrate Facebook Instant Games with your Unity project. Since the Facebook Instant Games SDK is originally a JavaScript SDK, this package is compatible only with web builds.

Key features include identity verification, user data access, in-app purchases, and social sharing integrations. By using this package, Unity developers can leverage the same powerful tools for analytics, monetization, and player engagement that Meta developers use, bringing top-tier social gaming experiences to their web-based Unity games.

This package is available as an experimental package, so it's not ready for production use. The features and documentation in this package might change before it's verified for release.
