# Facebook Instant Games SDK for Unity

This package provides C# bindings to the Facebook Instant Games SDK, making it easy to integrate Facebook Instant Games with your Unity project. Since the Facebook Instant Games SDK is originally a JavaScript SDK, this package is compatible only with web builds.\n\nKey features include identity verification, user data access, in-app purchases, and social sharing integrations. By using this package, Unity developers can leverage the same powerful tools for analytics, monetization, and player engagement that Meta developers use, bringing top-tier social gaming experiences to their web-based Unity games.
